.SH NAME

ffedit - editing videos through ffmpeg bash script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
ffedit [OPTIONS] [ARGS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]ffedit\f[R] is a script that is meant to make editing with ffmpeg a
lot less tedious and more streamlined.
This a much faster then utilising a full GUI video editor for simple
edits.
.PP
\f[B]ffedit\f[R] works from a simple bash script that is easy to
understand for even beginners of both unix and ffedit.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-t [Video file] [Output video name]\f[R]
Trim video using mpv.
Find the first timestamp with mpv, press q once done and repeat for the
second time stamp
.TP
\f[B]-j [Total amount of videos] [Video1] [Video2] \&... [Output File]\f[R]
Concat/join video together.
Warning, there may be errors when concatenating videos with different
formats.
For most ideal results make sure the files are in the same format before
concatenating
.TP
\f[B]-c [Video file] [Output name + format]\f[R]
Cut out a section of a video.
Essentially makes you select two sections and uses the preexisting trim
and concat features to cut out that section of the video.
.TP

Convert video to gif.
.TP
\f[B]-s [Video file] [Length] [Width] [Output name]\f[R]
Scales video.
.TP
\f[B]-x [Video file] [Width] [Height] [X Offset] [Y Offset] [Output name]\f[R]
Crop video.
In the future I would like to make a or utilise some simple tool to make
cropping painless and a lot easier compared to this method.
.TP

Extracts sound.
.TP
\f[B]-m [Video file] [0 or 1] [Output name] [Amount of sections]\f[R]
Mute entire video or just sections.
0 is for muting the entire video.
If you choose 1 instead then you will have to state how many sections
you want to mute \f[I](for example 1 section equals 2 timestamps, 2
equals 4\&...)\f[R] it will prompt mpv so that you can find the
timestamps you desire
.TP
\f[B]-f [Video file] [Output name + format]\f[R]
Convert video.
Simple input the videofile and the output name and whatever format you
want it in.
.TP
\f[B]--update\f[R]
Will automatically get the latest version of the script and update if
your script is out-dated.
\f[B]Warning: If you have made local changes then you will want to make
sure you save as this will override it\f[R].
.TP
